## LiFi Assignment: Working with Events

tldr; description

# Pre requisites

- Docker 
- Node 18 
- Npm 

- build docker image 
- build compose 
- docker compose up
WIP

* `docker build -t lifi .`

# How to run 

WIP 
- npm run dev (nodemon)
- npm run start (prod) ? 

- npm run update-last block: manually upsert block if needed (debug stuff)

# Considerations 

WIP 

- Using ethers.js vs Moralis or another provider for event listening, pros/cons

- Exceed block range request - strategies to fetch big amount of block range, 
 * exponential backoff request emthod
 * multiple providers 
 * combination of above

- time constrains for doing correct tests and typegoose mocking things :melting-face:

# Final thoughts
